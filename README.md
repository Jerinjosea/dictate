# dictate
Tired of writing by looking at the screen? Want someone to dictate? then you are in the right place. this program can read any text aloud like a  person is reading. It gives the necessary pauses and tells you when a sentence is over.

It is a python code.
requires:
    pyttsx,
    time,
    os
  libraries
  
  It is not a perfect solution, But works fine
